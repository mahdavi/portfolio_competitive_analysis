			<td>Brand</td>
			<td>'Swedish'/European - The site gives the Swedish design feel, the same as IKEA.
				 Crisp, clean design.<br> Minimal - The site is very, very basic. 
				It only has an image, as simple as you can get. <br>
				Futuristic - I get a "futuristic" vibe from the site because it
				is different and abnormal from the usual layout.</td>
			
		</tr>	
		<tr>
			<td>Functionality</td>
			<td>If the function of the site was to show a set number of slides - 
				it does its job. The site only shows a few design examples and 
				ends with the email of the designer. There is nothing else on 
				the site -- only images. There is no text on the site
				describing the images.</td>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Interaction</td>
			<td>The side of the site has a white arrow that blends into the
				background. Clicking it navigates through the slides, then 
				repeating when you have come to the end of the slides. This 
				is the only interactive part of the site. Like I said before,
				 there is nothing on the site.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Navigation</td>
			<td>Navigation on this site is pretty bad. There are no words on 
				this page at all, the user is always forced to go forwards 
				for 13 "pages" before it cycles to the beginning again. </td>

					relationships and use friendlier words. 
					<br>Professional - They are a corporation and a business.<br>
					Simple - They don't use a lot of colors, and all the colors are slightly
					desaturated, so it feels like they concentrate on minimal and clean 	
					design.
					 </td>
			</tr>

				<td>Functionality</td>
				<td>Their site seems pretty functional. They have everything laid out in a way
					 where you can find everything you need. They have a place to go see samples
					of their work, a section on contacting them, and a blog. They cover all the
					 fundamental functions they need. Every page on the site has the same
					 designing and branding.</td>

				<td>Interaction</td>
				<td>As far as interaction, the site requires the user to do everything. 
					There is no automation. The site is entirely click-only. Although, 
					when the user is viewing the work section on the home page, it 
					highlights the text the mouse is hovering over and dims the other 
					texts</td>

					each one takes you exactly there. The pages are also named after 
					their navigation bar name i.e. Work takes you to "Our Work." 
					The navigation bar never changes so the user may always go back.</td>

					<td>Brand</td>
					<td>Techy - They try to market themselves as programmers and coders
						and use that terminology on their page.
						<br>Mature - they have a lot of projects and want to show it off
						so they want to show that they are experienced and mature.
						<br>Bland - This probably wasn't their intent, but I also thought
						 the site was bland, so that's part of their identity</td>

						keeps the site the same and just updates the text. It's useful for 
						visitors who don't speak the main languages the site is in. Contact
						info is also available on the top of the webpage.

					<td>Brand</td>
					<td>Professional - The name of the company is Consulo and they
						 have a few general "business"/corporate words, so it gives
						 the site a very professional personality. I think the site might be
						focused on selling its products to large businesses (or at least
						 it feels that way.)
						<br>Worldwide - Some of the articles on this site are in Greek, and they 
						also have an option to chose what language the site is in. I think they
						 want to show that they are an international company and use it to their
						 advantage by showing themselves like that	.

						 a couple of pictures.</td>

					<b><thead>Guerrilla Design and Development</thead></b>
					<p>Portfolio of Mike Smith, wordpress designer and developer.

					<td>Brand</td>
					<td>Friendly- The testimonials on his site give insight to his 
						character which is perceived to be friendly and helpful.<br>
						Informal - but still a little professional. By using really
						informal language, such as "kickass" he retains his friendliness
						as well.<br>
						Dedication - He has made clear his design and development
						is for only one platform, Wordpress. This shows dedication and 
						commitment to that technology. 
						 </td>
				</tr>	
				<tr>
					<td>Functionality</td>
					<td>The site shows the examples of his work right next to his
						 testimonials and also has examples of his work all over 
						without having to navigate elsewhere. This way he gets to 
						advertise his work immediately and sell the visitor to his
						 work. Gets the job done quickly, and if the user wants to
						 see more, they can navigate to more examples of his work
						 pretty easily. Contacting him is visible - he has a tab on 
						 top navigation bar.</td>

				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Interaction</td>
					<td>There is a showcase box on the central box of the page with 
						animations that scroll through his design work, but the user
						 may also use the arrows to control the rate of change and
						 navigate through examples themselves. Going over the testimonial
						screenshots dims the color and shows a magnifying class that means
						the user can click it to get a closer view.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Navigation</td>
					<td>Pretty easy. Again, since this is Wordpress, it automatically
						puts links and headers in all places so that there are no orphan pages.
						All the main pages that people would want to see are on the top 
						navigation bar.</td>

					<b><thead>Digitalmash</thead></b>
					<p>Portfolio Robyn Morris, a graphic designer.
						 http://www.digitalmash.com/</p><p>Layout: Words.</p>

					<td>Brand</td>
					<td>Creative - The site is coded differently and creatively,
						 which is refreshing. The main navigation through the site
						 is all text based and only the articles have images.<br>
						New - Again, being creative with the coding brings a new 
						view on the site, one that isn't very common giving a new-feeling
						personality for the site.<br>
						Fun - The navigation and links are labeled very uncommonly,
						 like "the real jim shady," playing on pop culture and 
						giving it a different feel from other websites.</td>
				</tr>	
				<tr>
					<td>Functionality</td>
					<td>It's a portfolio site, so it accomplishes its task of displaying 
						the creative work. The site is completely minimal and only 
						shows images when it needs to. It's a cool site, but maybe he 
						should have shown more images since he is a graphic artist and
						 that is what he wants to advertise.
						</td>

				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Interaction</td>
					<td>Even though this is a portfolio of a graphic designer, 
						the interaction on the site is really cool. By running 
						the cursor over the links, each one highlights a different
						color. Clicking a link opens the article underneath, without 
						taking you to a new page, making navigation easier.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Navigation</td>
					<td>Pretty simple. Clicking a link opens it in the same page
					 so you can scroll back up to go to where you where. To go another page, 
					you can just use the navbar, which takes you to a page that is titled with 
					the exact page you're on, making navigation easy.</td>

						it adds to their brand personality that they operate
						worldwide.<br>
						Mysterious- they don't really say exactly what they 
						have been working on, but they show snippets and some
						 previews, so they want to have an aura of mystery about

						a good job of organizing content. They have a footer that shows

						to go to one of the pages, but I don't know which one I should go to.
						The pages are named About, Case Studies, and Digital.Memories. 
						I don't know which one would have more examples of their work.</td>

						Fresh - Throughout the site, they're talking about how

						 that portfolio sites have and the regular layout sites
						 have and advances into a whole new type of navigation.						  
						<br>Hip - A lot of different design styles are shown, his designs are
							hip and trendy and appeal to that culture.
						<br>Edgy - They use a lot of different technologies, including
						    the way that you have to navigate through it.</td>

					pretty fun. The controls are easy to understand and use</td>

					<td>Navigation</td>
					<td>The navigation through the site is pretty fun. You scroll
						 vertically to view different projects,	and horizontally 
						to view each projects screenshots. You may also use the 
						arrow keys on the left or the arrows. It's not really 
						important knowing exactly what project you're looking at 
						since it scrolls through all of them, but going back 
						on each slide is easy, just navigate in the opposite direction.
