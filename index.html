			<p>Freelance designer Hakan Schallinger. http://www.schallinger.se/</p>
			<p>Layout: Image-only</p>
			
			<td>Brand</td>
			<td>Swedish - The site gives the Swedish design feel, the same as IKEA.
				 Crisp, clean design.<br> Minimal - The site is very, very basic. 
				It only has an image, as simple as you can get. <br>
				Futuristic - I get a "futuristic" vibe from the site because it
				is different and abnormal from the usual layout.</td>
			
		</tr>	
		<tr>
			<td>Functionality</td>
			<td>If the function of the site was to show a set number of slides - 
				it does its job. The site only shows a few design examples and 
				ends with the email of the designer. There is nothing else on 
				the site -- only images. There is no text on the site
				describing the images.</td>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Interaction</td>
			<td>The side of the site has a white arrow that blends into the
				background. Clicking it navigates through the slides, then 
				repeating when you have come to the end of the slides. This 
				is the only interactive part of the site. Like I said before,
				 there is nothing on the site.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Navigation</td>
			<td>Navigation on this site is pretty bad. There are no words on 
				this page at all, the user is always forced to go forwards 
				for 13 "pages" before it cycles to the beginning again. </td>

				<td>Brand</td>
				<td>Friendly - they try to describe everything to the user and want to build  	
					relationships and use friendlier words. 
					<br>Professional - They are a corporation and a business.<br>
					Simple - They don't use a lot of colors, and all the colors are slightly
					desaturated, so it feels like they concentrate on minimal and clean 	
					design.
					 </td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
				<td>Functionality</td>
				<td>Their site seems pretty functional. They have everything laid out in a way
					 where you can find everything you need. They have a place to go see samples
					of their work, a section on contacting them, and a blog. They cover all the
					 fundamental functions they need. </td>

			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Interaction</td>
				<td>As far as interaction, the site requires the user to do everything. 
					There is no automation. The site is entirely click-only. Although, 
					when the user is viewing the work section on the home page, it 
					highlights the text the mouse is hovering over and dims the other 
					texts</td>

				<td>Navigation</td>
				<td>There is a navigation bar up on the top of the page, and clicking 
					each one takes you exactly there. The pages are also named after 
					their navigation bar name i.e. Work takes you to "Our Work." 
					The navigation bar never changes so the user may always go back.</td>

					<td>Brand</td>
					<td>Friendly- The testimonials on his site give insight to his 
						character which is perceived to be friendly and helpful.<br>
						Informal - but still a little professional. By using really
						informal language, such as "kickass" he retains his friendliness
						as well.<br>
						Dedication - He has made clear his design and development
						is for only one platform, Wordpress. This shows dedication and 
						commitment to that technology. 
						 </td>
				</tr>	
				<tr>
					<td>Functionality</td>
					<td>The site shows the examples of his work right next to his
						 testimonials and also has examples of his work all over 
						without having to navigate elsewhere. This way he gets to 
						advertise his work immediately and sell the visitor to his
						 work. Gets the job done quickly, and if the user wants to
						 see more, they can navigate to more examples of his work
						 pretty easily.</td>

				</tr>

						animations that scroll through his design work, but the user
						 may also use the arrows to control the rate of change and

					<b><thead>Digitalmash</thead></b>
					<p>Portfolio Robyn Morris, a graphic designer.
						 http://www.digitalmash.com/</p><p>Layout: Words.</p>

					<td>Brand</td>
					<td>Creative - The site is coded differently and creatively,
						 which is refreshing. The main navigation through the site
						 is all text based and only the articles have images.<br>
						New - Again, being creative with the coding brings a new 
						view on the site, one that isn't very common giving a new-feeling
						personality for the site.<br>
						Fun - The navigation and links are labeled very uncommonly,
						 like "the real jim shady," playing on pop culture and 
						giving it a different feel from other websites.</td>
				</tr>	
				<tr>
					<td>Functionality</td>
					<td>It's a portfolio site, so it accomplishes its task of displaying 
						the creative work. The site is completely minimal and only 
						shows images when it needs to. It's a cool site, but maybe he 
						should have shown more images since he is a graphic artist and
						 that is what he wants to advertise.
						</td>

				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Interaction</td>
					<td>Even though this is a portfolio of a graphic designer, 
						the interaction on the site is really cool. By running 
						the cursor over the links, each one highlights a different
						color. Clicking a link opens the article underneath, without 
						taking you to a new page, making navigation easier.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Navigation</td>
					<td>Pretty simple. Clicking a link opens it in the same page
					 so you can scroll back up to go to where you where. To go another page, 
					you can just use the navbar, which takes you to a page that is titled with 
					the exact page you're on, making navigation easy.</td>

						 casual and cool about the way they conduct their business. <br>
						Fresh - Throughout the site, they're talking about how
						 they 'not only' do some things, they also enhance, so
